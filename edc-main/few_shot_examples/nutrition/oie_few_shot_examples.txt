Example 1:
Text: Patients with type 2 diabetes should limit refined carbohydrates and increase dietary fiber intake.
Triplets: [['dietary_fiber', 'recommended_for', 'type_2_diabetes'], ['refined_carbohydrates', 'aggravates', 'type_2_diabetes']]

Example 2:
Text: Vitamin D deficiency is commonly observed in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Calcium supplementation combined with vitamin D may help regulate blood pressure.

Example 3:
Text: Chronic kidney disease patients must restrict protein intake to 0.6-0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Phosphorus-rich foods should be limited in patients with chronic kidney disease.
Triplets: [['chronic_kidney_disease', 'restricts', 'protein_intake'], ['chronic_kidney_disease', 'restricts', 'phosphorus_rich_foods'], ['protein_intake', 'daily_intake', '0.6-0.8_g/kg/day']]

Example 4:
Text: Iron deficiency anemia responds well to iron supplementation and consumption of iron-rich foods including red meat and spinach. Vitamin C enhances iron absorption when consumed with iron-rich foods.

Example 5:
Text: Gout patients should avoid purine-rich foods such as organ meats, shellfish, and alcohol. Increased water intake helps excrete uric acid and reduces gout attacks.
Triplets: [['purine_rich_foods', 'contraindicated_for', 'gout'], ['organ_meats', 'aggravates', 'gout'], ['water_intake', 'reduces', 'uric_acid_level'], ['water_intake', 'treats', 'gout']]

Example 6:
Text: Osteoporosis prevention requires adequate calcium intake of 1000-1200 mg per day combined with weight-bearing exercise. Vitamin K2 plays a critical role in bone mineralization and reduces fracture risk.
Triplets: [['calcium', 'prevents', 'osteoporosis'], ['calcium', 'daily_intake', '1000-1200_mg/day'], ['vitamin_K2', 'reduces', 'fracture_risk'], ['vitamin_K2', 'recommended_for', 'osteoporosis']]
