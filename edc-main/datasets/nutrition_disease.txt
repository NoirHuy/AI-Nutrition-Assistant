Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should limit refined carbohydrates and increase dietary fiber intake. Whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables are recommended to improve glycemic control. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil may reduce insulin resistance in diabetic patients.
Vitamin D deficiency is commonly observed in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Calcium supplementation combined with vitamin D may help regulate blood pressure. Excessive sodium intake above 2300 mg per day increases the risk of hypertension.
Chronic kidney disease patients must restrict protein intake to 0.6-0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Phosphorus-rich foods such as dairy products and processed meats should be limited in patients with chronic kidney disease. Potassium restriction is required for patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 and 5.
Iron deficiency anemia responds well to iron supplementation and consumption of iron-rich foods including red meat, spinach, and fortified cereals. Vitamin C enhances iron absorption when consumed with iron-rich foods. Folate deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and can be treated with folic acid supplementation.
Patients with celiac disease must strictly avoid gluten found in wheat, barley, and rye. Zinc deficiency is prevalent in celiac disease patients due to malabsorption. A gluten-free diet reduces intestinal inflammation and promotes nutrient absorption in celiac disease.
Gout patients should avoid purine-rich foods such as organ meats, shellfish, and alcohol, especially beer. Increased water intake helps excrete uric acid and reduces the frequency of gout attacks. Cherries and cherry extract have been shown to reduce uric acid levels in gout patients.
Osteoporosis prevention requires adequate calcium intake of 1000-1200 mg per day combined with weight-bearing exercise. Vitamin K2 plays a critical role in bone mineralization and reduces fracture risk in osteoporosis patients. Excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption accelerates calcium loss and worsens osteoporosis.
Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease benefit from reducing total calorie intake and increasing consumption of antioxidant-rich foods. Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil, vegetables, and fish reduces liver fat accumulation in fatty liver disease. Fructose overconsumption is strongly associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Hyperthyroidism patients may experience weight loss and increased metabolic rate requiring higher caloric intake. Iodine restriction is recommended for patients undergoing radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism. Selenium supplementation may help reduce thyroid antibodies in autoimmune thyroid disease.
Children with phenylketonuria must follow a phenylalanine-restricted diet to prevent neurological damage. Low-phenylalanine medical formulas provide essential amino acids for phenylketonuria patients. Regular blood phenylalanine monitoring is essential to adjust dietary intake in phenylketonuria management.
